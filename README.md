**Write clean, robust, and maintainable web and server code using functional JavaScript and TypeScript**

## What is this book about?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that uses functions for developing software. This book is filled with examples that enable you to leverage the latest JavaScript and TypeScript versions to produce modern and clean code, as well as teach you to how apply functional programming techniques to develop more efficient algorithms, write more concise code, and simplify unit testing.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand when to use functional programming versus classic object-oriented programming
* Use declarative coding instead of imperative coding for clearer, more understandable code
* Know how to avoid side effects and create more reliable code with closures and immutable data
* Use recursion to help design and implement more understandable solutions to complex problems
* Define functional programing data types with or without TypeScript, add type checking, and implement immutability
* Apply advanced containers to get better structures to tackle errors and implement async programming

  arr.reverse();
  return arr.join("");
};

console.log(reverseString("MONTEVIDEO")); // OEDIVETNOM

```
